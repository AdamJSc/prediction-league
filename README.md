# Prediction League ‚öΩÔ∏è‚Äç üîÆ üßô‚Äç

**v2.3.2**

## About

### Background

Prediction League is a game that started socially between friends.

Everyone in the group puts some coins into the kitty and writes down what they think the final Premier League table will
look like, before a ball has even been kicked.

Whoever is closest at the end of the season wins the kitty. And sometimes gets to pick the following week‚Äôs teams for
6-a-side...

### Who needs pen-and-paper?? üìù

This project is a digital representation of the game with some additional "gamification" to retain engagement throughout
the season (players can swap the position of two teams in their table each Match Week).

This repo implements a frontend and backend for handling new entries, payment workflows, management of predictions and
scoring of points (which are now accrued on a cumulative basis throughout the season instead of just at the end).

## Stack üíª

The project is written predominantly in [Go](https://golang.org/), using [templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/)
to generate  dynamic HTML.

[Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) are used on the frontend.

[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) is used for pre-processing CSS and [npm](https://npmjs.com/) + [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
are used for building assets.

It's hosted at [play.taybl.app](https://play.taybl.app).

## Local Environment ‚ôªÔ∏è üå≥

To read about the passive-aggressive joys of trying to scaffold this project in the first place, see [docs/local-environment-setup.md](docs/local-environment-setup.md)

### Configuring Dependencies

The following environment variables must be set in order to configure the usage of third-party dependencies.

You can do this by creating a new `.env` file in the project root, or overriding the contents of `infra/app.env`
and `infra/app.docker.env` as required.

Leaving the following values blank will result in the default behaviour as described.

* `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`
    * Client ID as required by PayPal's [Basic Checkout Integration](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/integrate/)
    workflow.
    * If left blank, provides a "skip payment" step during sign-up (for debugging purposes only).

* `MAILGUN_API_KEY`
    * API Key required by [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) integration for transactional emails.
    * If left blank, dumps content of email to the terminal without sending.

* `FOOTBALLDATA_API_TOKEN`
    * API Key required by [football-data.org](https://www.football-data.org/) integration for consumption of real-world
    football league table data.
    * If left blank, no latest league table standings are retrieved and processed by the cron job.

### Fully-Dockerised Setup

Look out for CPU with this option. Where the asset builds are watching for changes across a network, it
can become quite resource-hungry...

#### Requirements

* [Docker](https://docker.com/) + [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose)
* [GNU Make](https://gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)

#### Run App

```bash
make app.docker.up
```

#### Run Testsuite

```bash
make test.docker.up
```

## Partly-Dockerised Setup

Requires more dependencies installed on the host machine, but results in generally quieter fans...

### Requirements

* [Golang](https://golang.org/) 1.18
* [npm](https://npmjs.com/) 13.10 (or [nvm](http://nvm.sh))
* [Docker](https://docker.com/) + [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose)
* [GNU Make](https://gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)

### Run App

Make sure you're using npm version 13.10

```bash
# via nvm
nvm install 13.10
nvm use 13.10
```

Then start your engines:

```bash
make app.install
make app.run
```

### Run Testsuite

```bash
make test.run
```

N.B. Take a look at the other `make` commands in the project root `Makefile` which help to automate
some of the stop/restart/kill workflows too.

### Demo Seeder

To seed a demo version of the game, carry out the following:

```bash
cp service/cmd/demoseeder/.env.example service/cmd/demoseeder/.env
go run service/cmd/demoseeder/main.go
```

To cleanup the changes made by the demo seeder, execute the file `service/cmd/demoseeder/cleanup.sql` against the database.

## Key Concepts

### Entries and Predictions

Players can sign-up to create an [Entry](docs/domain-knowledge.md#entry) and make their first [Prediction](docs/domain-knowledge.md#entryprediction)
before the [Season](docs/domain-knowledge.md#season) begins.

They can make subsequent changes to their [Prediction](docs/domain-knowledge.md#entryprediction) throughout the
[Season](docs/domain-knowledge.md#season) - swapping the positions of a maximum two [Teams](docs/domain-knowledge.md#team)
per [Match Week](#match-weeks).

Timeframes are configured independently for each [Season](docs/domain-knowledge.md#season).

For example, no more [Entries](docs/domain-knowledge.md#entry) can be made once the [Season's](docs/domain-knowledge.md#season) `EntriesAccepted`
timeframe has elapsed.

Additional settings can also be configured for each [Realm](docs/domain-knowledge.md#realm) (an instance of the game which
runs on a particular URL/sub-domain).

### Payments

Each [Entry](docs/domain-knowledge.md#entry) requires a payment in order to be accepted into the game.

This is to fund the kitty that the winner receives at the end of the game.

For convenience and user peace-of-mind, payment is made via PayPal using their [Basic Checkout Integration](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/integrate/).

Given that the payment flow exists entirely on the Frontend, each [Entry](docs/domain-knowledge.md#entry) must be "approved" by an
Admin in order that payment can be verified manually.

This is a single API endpoint that is protected by Basic Auth. These Basic Auth credentials can be configured via the
`.env` variable named `ADMIN_BASIC_AUTH`.

Payment can be skipped when running locally for debugging purposes, by leaving the `.env` variable named `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`
with an empty value.

### Match Weeks

Each [Season](docs/domain-knowledge.md#season) is broken down into a number of "Match Weeks", which work the same as in
[Fantasy Football](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/).

i.e. For a Premier League season with 20 teams, there are 38 Match Weeks.
For a Championship season with 24 teams, there are 46 Match Weeks.

Once a new Match Week starts, the previous Match Week‚Äôs score is frozen and the next Match Week begins with a fresh score.

### Scoring

For every [Match Week](#match-weeks), each [Prediction](docs/domain-knowledge.md#entryprediction) receives a score, which produces
a [Scored Prediction](docs/domain-knowledge.md#scoredentryprediction) for that Match Week.

Each player begins with 100 points every Match Week, and accrues 1 "hit point" for each position that a [Team](docs/domain-knowledge.md#team)
has been placed incorrectly within their Prediction.

For example, if Team A are in 3rd place but are predicted to be in 1st, `2` hit points will be accrued.

Likewise, placing Team B at the bottom (in 20th), who sit in 15th in the real table, will accrue `5` hit points.

Placing a team in the exact position they are in the real-world table will receive `0` hit points.

The total number of hit points is added up and then deducted from the player's initial 100 points, to give them their
overall score for that Match Week.

### Leaderboard

The total cumulative score for all players' [Scored Predictions](docs/domain-knowledge.md#scoredentryprediction) across
all [Match Weeks](#match-weeks) forms the foundation of the [Leaderboard](docs/domain-knowledge.md#leaderboard).
The Leaderboard is topped by the player with the highest cumulative score across all Match Weeks.

In the event of a tie on the Leaderboard, the tied players will be ordered by the **maximum** score that each one has
gained throughout all Match Weeks so far, highest first. You can think  of this as the equivalent of ‚Äúgoal difference‚Äù
when ranking teams who are on equal points in a real-world league table.

### Data Source

The real-world league table data used to calculate each score is retrieved from [football-data.org](https://www.football-data.org/).

This data source is polled every 15 minutes as a cron task.

At this point, the most recently made [Prediction](docs/domain-knowledge.md#entryprediction)
for each [Entry](docs/domain-knowledge.md#entry) is used to calculate the [Scored Prediction](docs/domain-knowledge.md#scoredentryprediction)
for the current Match Week. It is also used to determine if a new Match Week has begun, or if the final Match Week has
ended (at which point the [Season](docs/domain-knowledge.md#season) is considered to be complete and is therefore finalised).

### FAQ

The frontend accommodates an FAQ page which can be customised on a per-[Realm](docs/domain-knowledge.md#realm) basis.
